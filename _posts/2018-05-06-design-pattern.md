Design Pattern notebook. From head first design patterns. Updating<!--more-->

## OO Basic

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

## Design Priciple

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them fom what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon cincrete classes.
 
## Build Pattern

### The Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable.Stratey les the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### The Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency objects so that when one object change state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### The Decorator Pattern

Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### The Factory Method Pattern

Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
